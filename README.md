# Python Flask TODO Server

This project is a TODO server built with [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/), a popular minimal server framework for Python. It provides a simple yet dynamic TODO API where you can perform CRUD operations on TODO items. The server is deployed on [Railway](https://railway.app/), and you can access it [here](https://flask-production-07b5.up.railway.app/).
